## 🏆 About CodeVengers & Hackfest Journey  

We are **Team CodeVengers** — a group of learners who believe that knowledge is a superpower.

Our journey began when we received this official message:

> “Congratulations! Your project has been officially accepted for Hackfest, organized by GDG New Delhi and powered by Agora…”

This Hackfest encouraged us to **build something creative + impactful for real-life student problems**.  
We all know how overwhelming it feels to revise a huge syllabus just before exams —  
That is exactly what inspired us to create **Smart Study Partner**.

We imagined:
> “What if students could simply *talk* to their notes like a friend?”

And boom —  
The idea was born:  
✔ A simple interface  
✔ AI explanation  
✔ Quiz generation  
✔ Study planning  
✔ Local + AI support  

We named ourselves **CodeVengers** because we love assembling ideas and solving problems collaboratively (and yes, we like superheroes 😄).  

This project reflects:
- Our personal struggles with revision  
- Our attempt to solve a real need  
- Countless late-night debugging sessions  
- And a lot of excitement and learning  

This is more than a submission —  
It’s a dream we want to take to the next level 🚀

## 💡 Why Smart Study Partner?  

Students face common issues:  
✅ Huge notes difficult to revise  
✅ Don’t know what topics matter more  
✅ Lack of interactive learning  
✅ Forgetting quickly  
✅ Study feels lonely  

So we re-imagined the revision experience:  
> “Chat with your syllabus.”  

Instead of reading pages of text, just ask:  
> “Explain this topic simply”  
> “Give me a short summary”  
> “Quiz me quickly”  

The result:  
✅ Fast learning  
✅ Stress-free revision  
✅ Personalized study
